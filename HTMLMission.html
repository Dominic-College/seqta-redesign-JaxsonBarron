<h1> Mission Captains </h1>
<p class="HouseMO"> Our goal as Mission captains: <br>
	Through the course of 2020 we as Mission captains hope to raise enough money for project compassion and to make an all-time record. It is also about getting other students on board about causes we fundraise for, explaining why we do it, where the money and time goes to and who it goes to. We as mission captains are also making success look like raising awareness and getting students and staff to understand what these causes are about. We would also like to make the profile as a mission captain not as a bludge leadership, but as a leadership that takes time and effort. We need to raise the standards that previous mission captains have set.</p>
