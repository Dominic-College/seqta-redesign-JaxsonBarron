<p class="CaptainsMO"> Our goal joing goal as College and Vice captians <br>
	As College Captains and College Vice Captains, success for us can come in many different forms. We believe that the way we can successfully lead the school will be through inspiring people the best way we can, by participating and having enthusiasm for any tasks given to us; making a positive impact on the school to ensure that we are viewed in a fond way when we have left the school; and bringing new and fresh ideas to the table and looking to improve the school in as many ways as we can.</p>
