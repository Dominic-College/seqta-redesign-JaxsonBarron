<h1> Creative Arts Captains </h1>
<p class="HouseMO">
	Our goal as Creative arts captains: Through the course of 2020 we as creative captains wish to view and respond to our emails, listen and provide timely responses to time sensitive requests and in doing so allow our peers to complete their assessment tasks requiring our input. 
<br> “Can’t you just make it up for us” – Jack Cassidy (Dominic College Siena Creative arts captain 2020)
<br> unfortunately due to the creative arts captains not responding to my request for Mission Statements disregarding multiple reminders a placeholder Mission Statement was provided.
