<h1> Sport Captains </h1>
<p class="HouseMO">Our goal as sport captians: Success for us as Sport captains for 2020 is the completion of our joint goal to increase participation throughout both in class and co-curricular sport at Dominic College, Involvement in sport has been proven to result in improvement of physical and mental health and thus through completion of our primary goal we also wish to improve class morale and the learning environment within our school. Activities our team assist to run such as Mental Health week, Co-Curricular sports and Dominic College athletics are but a small step toward the happy, healthy DC student team we as captains strive for this year. We hope through our experiences at Dominic leading our fellow students we ourselves can develop into better leaders and better people.</p>
